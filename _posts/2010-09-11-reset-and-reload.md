Long time no see, everyone.

First of all, the blog has been moved. The new blog address is [http://zeuxcg.org](http://zeuxcg.org), and the new feed address is [http://zeuxcg.org/feed](http://zeuxcg.org/feed). Please, update your bookmarks!

In addition to changing the address, I've changed the blogging platform - this blog is now powered by WordPress, which at first impression is superior to Blogger in many ways - built-in code highlighter, built-in 'read more' support, image storage, slightly better html generation (i.e. it does not screw my posts up as often as Blogger did), better themes, non-anonymous comments without Google account, etc. I bet there are some downsides, but anyway I hope it will be a better experience (and will motivate me to write more posts, of course).

All old posts are imported from Blogger along with the comments; their contents is left as is, apart from minor cleanup and link cross-reference.

Previously most of my posts were of considerable length; I've even got as far as stuffing several completely different notes in a single post. The format is going to change slightly - there are going to be small notes as well as normal sized posts. Also probably the amount of non-graphics related posts is going to increase; still, I'll try to keep the content mostly relevant to game development.
