## Work

I'm a programmer at [Gamefam](https://gamefam.com/), the largest development team on the [Roblox](https://roblox.com) platform. Previously, I worked part-time at MetaMethod working daily on really awesome projects that peaked my interest. I've also assisted with cheat prevention at various front page games, some including [Strucid](https://www.roblox.com/games/2377868063/ZONE-WAR-Strucid) and [ER:LC](https://www.roblox.com/games/2534724415/Emergency-Response-Liberty-County).

## Side Projects

### SimpleAdmin

[SimpleAdmin](https://github.com/crywink/SimpleAdmin) was started as a small project for me to continue my understanding of framework design. It eventually grew to become one of the most popular administration tools on the Roblox platform. It has since been archived and is pending a rewrite.

### SimpleAnticheat

SimpleAnticheat, founded under the SimpleAdmin umbrella, is an all-in-one solution to exploiters in your Roblox game. Writing it was an amazing learning experience that helped me truly understand how exploiting works on a low level. With the help of various friends and contributors, SimpleAnticheat now protects hundreds of games.

## Accomplishments

### 2021-2022 IncubatorEDU Winner

In May of 2022, I won the IncubatorEDU program to cap off my high school career. I successfully built a
business and pitched it to a group of investors who quickly chose my project as the winner.
